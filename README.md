# CyberStart-Practice

This repository includes the solution to the Python Practice-2 for the "IBM ile kodluyoruz: CyberStart" program.
The practice includes the following details.

Task:
Using the concepts of functions and loops in Python, you need to write a program that performs the following operations:

Defining Points:
Create a list named **points**. This list should contain tuples representing points in 2D space. For example, the point **(x, y)** will be represented as a tuple **(x, y)**.

Writing a Function for Euclidean Distance:
Define a function named **euclideanDistance**. This function should take two tuples (each representing a point) and return the Euclidean distance between these two points.

Calculating Distances:
Using a loop, calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of points in the **points** list. Store these distances in another list called **distances**.

Finding the Minimum Distance:
Find and print the minimum distance from the **distances** list.
